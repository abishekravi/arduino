# Arduino
This repository consists of arduino code for controlling electrical devices remotely from anywhere using node mcu and wifi
# IOT 
I built an IOT system for controlling electrical devices with the help of wifi. 
Using an android application called  'Blynk' we can connect the node mcu module with wifi and with the relay which controls the electrical devices.
Then we can access the power button of the devices from our app. The source code is uploaded here. For any questions DM me.
